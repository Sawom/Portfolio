export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am eager to use my skills in full-stack web development, especially with the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I enjoy solving problems and working well in a team to build user-friendly web applications. I am looking for a role where I can face new challenges, learn, and create useful digital solutions with other talented developers.
I do my best work when I can share ideas and take part in all parts of a project, from planning and building to launching and improving it after release. I also like to help others learn by sharing what I know and building a positive team environment. My goal is to use my skills to create projects that users love and help businesses succeed.
